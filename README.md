This Project is done as the part of Maven Pizza [Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-pizza-challenge/4).

### About The Data Set
A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served,
with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

### Challenge Objective
For the Maven Pizza Challenge, youâ€™ll be playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. 
You've been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operations.
Here are some questions that we'd like to be able to answer:

- What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
- How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
- What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
- What's our average order value?
- How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)
